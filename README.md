# Rollercoaster-Ticket-Machine (Beginner Project)
100 DoC Python Day 3 Project: Rollercoaster Ticket Machine

### This Python program does the following:
1. Takes user input for height
2. Uses an if/else statement to decide whether if the user is tall enough to ride the rollercoaster
3. If the user's height is less than 120cm, the program exits without any further code execution
4. Otherwise, the user is prompted to enter the duration of ride that he wants, and the ticket cost is then printed based on the duration of ride.
